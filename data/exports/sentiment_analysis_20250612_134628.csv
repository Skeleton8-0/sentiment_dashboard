For example, intelligent tutoring systems can adapt to a student's individual pace, helping them master concepts more efficiently. This creates a more engaging and inclusive learning environment — a major positive shift for students who struggle in traditional classrooms.",positive,96.37,"educators, optimistic, potential, personalize, learning"
"However, there are aspects of AI in education that remain uncertain. While it offers scalability and convenience, its long-term impact on teacher roles and student behavior is still under review. The ethical use of student data also requires more clarity. These considerations are neither good nor bad at this stage but should be watched carefully.",neutral,69.48,"uncertain, aspects, education, remain, student"
"On the downside, some institutions have rushed into using AI tools without proper training or oversight, leading to poor results. Students may receive incorrect feedback, or teachers might rely too heavily on automation, reducing meaningful interaction. If misused, AI could widen the educational gap rather than close it.",negative,88.7,"downside, oversight, leading, results, institutions"
